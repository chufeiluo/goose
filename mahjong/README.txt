Developed as part of a school project, a greedy algorithm to find a winning set of mahjong tiles from a deal sequence.

Winning set is defined as:
	- 3 of either (a) run of numbers, all different suits, or (b) 3 of a kind
	- one pair (2 identical tiles)

The test deal sequences are likely IP of my professor so they're not included, but the constraints and format are in dealseq_instructions.txt.

mahjong_main.py - main file; use function play('filename of deal sequence here') to run
mahjong_aux.py - the classes used in main as well as some helper functions
